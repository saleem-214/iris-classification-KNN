# 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🎯 Objective
Build a classification model that predicts the species of an iris flower (Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements.

---

## 📚 Dataset
- Source: `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
- Features:
  - Sepal Length
  - Sepal Width
  - Petal Length
  - Petal Width
- Target: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, seaborn, matplotlib
- scikit-learn

---

## ⚙️ Steps Performed
1. Loaded the Iris dataset using sklearn
2. Converted to pandas DataFrame for exploration
3. Visualized features using pairplot and histograms
4. Split data into training and testing sets (80/20)
5. Trained a K-Nearest Neighbors model (k=3)
6. Predicted on test data
7. Evaluated using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix
8. Visualized confusion matrix using seaborn

## 📊 Result
- Accuracy: _(Fill in after running your notebook, e.g., 96.7%)_
- Model performed well on distinguishing between species.
